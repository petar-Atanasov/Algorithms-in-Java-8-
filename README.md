# Algorithms-in-Java-8-

###Purpose and Scope
##This document provides an overview of the Algorithms-in-Java-8- repository, an educational codebase designed to demonstrate fundamental algorithms and their Big O notation ##complexity analysis. The repository contains three self-contained algorithm implementations that showcase different computational complexity classes: linear search (O(n)), ##binary search (O(log n)), and selection sort (O(n²)).

For detailed implementation analysis of individual algorithms, see Linear Search Algorithm, Binary Search Algorithm, and Selection Sort Algorithm.

###Algorithm Portfolio
##The repository implements three core algorithms that represent distinct complexity classes within Big O notation analysis:

###Algorithm	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Data Requirements	Primary Use Case
##Linear Search	O(n)	O(1)	Unsorted arrays	Small datasets, unsorted data
##Binary Search	O(log n)	O(1)	Sorted arrays	Large sorted datasets
##Selection Sort	O(n²)	O(1)	Unsorted arrays	Educational demonstration

###Educational Context
##This repository serves as a practical demonstration of Big O notation concepts, providing concrete implementations that students can execute, analyze, and modify. The three ##algorithms represent different points on the computational complexity spectrum:

##Linear Search: Demonstrates O(n) complexity with straightforward sequential access
##Binary Search: Illustrates O(log n) efficiency through divide-and-conquer strategy
##Selection Sort: Shows O(n²) quadratic growth in a sorting context

##The consistent project structure across all three implementations allows students to compare algorithmic approaches while working within a familiar development environment.
